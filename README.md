# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview
Love to travel but hate guessing what the weather will be like? Check out PlanMyTrip, an up-and-coming resource that will recommend ideal hotels and locations all across the world based on what kind of weather you prefer. 

Just tell us what the coldest and hottest temperatures you'd like for your trip, and we will show you four cities you can visit within that temperature range. As an added bonus, we will find you a hotel in that city based on expert lodging recommendations. If you order within the next 30 minutes, we'll throw in our free route-planning service and give you directions between the four cities.
